<p>Welcome to Savvy! ...</p>

<h2>Design it your way</h2>

<p>Savvy is very clear about what it does: Savvy is an MVP application framework. It is the rock upon which you build your UI and presentation logic. And build it your way.</p>

<p>We're not about themes. Savvy apps are bespoke creations. Each one looks and behaves differently. What Savvy gives you is first-line-support for most the flexible UI paradigms and a laser-sighted MVP framework to develop on. That's the canvas. What goes in it is your creation.</p>

<h2>Presentation first</h2>

<p>Savvy apps are built on a bedrock of a modular HTML5 and CSS3 presentation layers backed highly-optomised JS presenter code.</p>

<p>HTML5 is an exciting new direction for cross-platform development combining a suite of declaratively programmed and natively-implemented widget types &ndash; from text and forms to images, audio and video and interactive 2D and 3D drawing surfaces.</p>

<p>Combined with the rich presentation language that is CSS3 and first-line-support for most the flexible UI paradigms, HTML5 in Savvy delivers a powerful view onto any application: be it the world's most functional admin interface or the next immersive gaming experience.</p>

<p>The MVP architecture beneath any Savvy app then backs this up with as-needed support from your non-native code.</p>

<h2>Hybrid apps</h2>

<p>The Savvy framework is built for fire-and-forget integration with <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/" target="_blank" title="Apache Cordova website">Apache Cordova</a>, the leading hybrid application framework for mobile and tablet. Developing for hybrid gives your app the opportunity mobilise out from HTML5 (should you need to) and harness the native potential of whatever device your application is running on.</p>

<p>And with <a hre="https://build.phonegap.com/" target="_blank" title="Adobe PhoneGap Build website">Adobe PhoneGap Build</a>, you don't even need to install any SDKs. You can build app-store ready hybrid apps in the cloud seamlessly from Savvy.</p>

<h2>Choose your language!</h2>

<p>Don't like JavaScript? No problem. Whatever your taste in language, Savvy comes pre-packed with support for four major coding paradigms. Keep it loose and imperative with CoffeeScript or try strictly-typed and classical object orientation with TypeScript. Planning on pushing things to the limit? Code like a god with C or C++. Or hack out your next great adventure in everyday JavaScript.</p>

<p>No matter the language you choose, Savvy compiles it down to highly-optomized JS using the <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/JavaScriptIsWebAssemblyLanguageAndThatsOK.aspx" target="_blank" title="
Scott Hanselman: 'JavaScript is Web Assembly Language and that's OK.'">JavaScript as an assembly language</a> perspective.</p>

<p>And CSS? Savvy has that covered too. Write in vanilla CSS &ndash; or go up a gear with Sass or Less. No matter what, Savvy builds and optomised your CSS before is passes out the door. In fact, Savvy apps are so optomised, we even optomise your HTML!</p>
