[Savvy](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/savvy) is an easy-to-use framework for developing [single-page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) [HTML5](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/) applications. It is intended for development of tablet, smart phone and smart TV apps, but it can also be used on PC and the web.

Savvy emphasises HTML, CSS and JavaScript as distinct technologies and employs a [Model-View-Presenter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter)-style paradigm for app development. Alongside HTML, CSS and JavaScript, Savvy understands [JSON](http://www.json.org/) (and [JXON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JXON)) data models right out of the box.
