# Savvy #

[Savvy](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/savvy) is a [HTML5](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/) applications framework for tablet, smart phone and smart TV.

Savvy applications follow the [Model-View-Presenter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter) design pattern. HTML/CSS views and JSON models are first-class citizens, supported by optomised JavaScript, CoffeeScript, TypeScript or Dart presenter code.

Plug-and-play support for [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) / [Adobe PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) is included out-of-the-box.
