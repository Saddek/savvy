{"name":"Savvy","tagline":"An easy-to-use framework for HTML-based app development (tablet, smart phone, smart TV or web).","body":"[Savvy](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/savvy) is an easy-to-use framework for developing [single-page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) [HTML5](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/) applications. It is intended for development of tablet, smart phone and smart TV apps, but it can also be used on PC and the web.\r\n\r\nSavvy emphasises HTML, CSS and JavaScript as distinct technologies and employs a [Model-View-Presenter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter)-style paradigm for app development. Alongside HTML, CSS and JavaScript, Savvy understands [JSON](http://www.json.org/) (and [JXON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JXON)) data models right out of the box.\r\n\r\n## Documentation ##\r\n\r\nSavvy apps are composed of screens. Screens in turn are composed of HTML, CSS and JavaScript snippets. Savvy provides the mechanism for transitioning between screens.\r\n\r\nSince Savvy solely provides a framework on the composing and transitioning between screens, it completely agnostic towards the choice of other libraries or frameworks. So, a developer may choose, for example, to perform DOM manipulation [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) or [Prototype](http://prototypejs.org/).\r\n\r\nFull documentation is available on [the Savvy GitHub wiki](https://github.com/avoca-learning/savvy/wiki).\r\n\r\n## License ##\r\n\r\nThe Savvy framework is open source and released under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
