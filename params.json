{"name":"Savvy","tagline":"An easy-to-use framework for HTML-based apps (for tablet, smart phone, and smart TV).","body":"[Savvy](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/savvy) is an easy-to-use framework for developing [single-page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) [HTML5](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/) applications. It is intended for development of tablet, smart phone and smart TV apps.\r\n\r\nSavvy employs a modularised [Model-View-Presenter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter)-style paradigm for app development. Alongside HTML, CSS and JavaScript, Savvy understands [JSON](http://www.json.org/) (and [JXON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JXON)) data models right out of the box.\r\n\r\n## Overview ##\r\n\r\nSavvy apps are composed of screens. Screens in turn are composed of HTML, CSS and JavaScript snippets. Savvy provides the mechanism for transitioning between screens.\r\n\r\nSince Savvy sole function is to provide a framework on the composing and transitioning screens, it is agnostic towards the choice of other libraries or frameworks. So, a developer may choose to perform DOM manipulation using [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) or [Prototype](http://prototypejs.org/), for example. Or may choose to use [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/), [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) or [Dush](http://linkedin.github.io/dustjs/) for templating.\r\n\r\n## Documentation ##\r\n\r\nFull documentation is available on [the Savvy GitHub wiki](https://github.com/avoca-learning/savvy/wiki).\r\n\r\n## License ##\r\n\r\nThe Savvy framework is open source and released under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
